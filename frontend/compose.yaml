# Here the instructions define your application as a service called "server".
# This service is built from the Dockerfile in the current directory.
# You can add other services your application may depend on here, such as a
# database or a cache. For examples, see the Awesome Compose repository:
# https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose
services:
  react-app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
      # Uncomment the following lines to pass build-time variables to the build process.
      # these are build arguments that can be used in the Dockerfile.
      # args:
      #     VITE_API_URL: http://localhost:3000
    # env_file:
    #   - ./.env
    ports:
      - 8300:80
    container_name: react-app
    restart: unless-stopped
    # environment:
    #   - REACT_APP_API_HOST=${REACT_APP_API_HOST}
    #   - REACT_APP_API_VERSION=${REACT_APP_API_VERSION}
# The commented ou section below is an example of how to define a PostgreSQL
# database that your application can use. `depends_on` tells Docker Compose to
# start the database before your application. The `db-data` volume persists the
# database data between container restarts. The `db-password` secret is used
# to set the database password. You must create `db/password.txt` and add
# a password of your choosing to it before running `docker-compose up`.
#     depends_on:
#       db:
#         condition: service_healthy
#   db:
#     image: postgres
#     restart: always
#     user: postgres
#     secrets:
#       - db-password
#     volumes:
#       - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
#     environment:
#       - POSTGRES_DB=example
#       - POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/db-password
#     expose:
#       - 5432

#       timeout: 5s
